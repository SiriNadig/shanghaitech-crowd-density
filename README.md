# shanghaitech-crowd-density
A computer vision project that utilizes a deep convolutional neural network (CSRNet) to estimate crowd density in high-density scenes using the ShanghaiTech dataset. The model predicts density maps from input images, and outputs are visualized as heatmaps to identify zones of congestion or crowd buildup.
